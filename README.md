# NABE_workbooks
For use with `colab.research.google.com`

Have to use slower source `install.packages`, rather than faster binary `!apt-get install r-cran-*` [Debian packages](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/) because colab can't run CLI commands from an R notebook (even when creating a [new blank one](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r))

I've had the notebooks download the zip files directly from GitHub, but users could upload those files themselves.
